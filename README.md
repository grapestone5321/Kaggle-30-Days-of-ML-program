## [30 Days of ML] Day 9

Hi Kaggler,

You’ve gotten acquainted with the fundamentals, and it’s time for some real excitement: today, you’ll build your own machine learning models to make intelligent predictions on a real-world dataset!

### 📋 Today’s Assignment
Read this tutorial (from Lesson 3 of the Intro to ML course)

Complete this exercise (from Lesson 3 of the Intro to ML course)

Read this tutorial (from Lesson 4 of the Intro to ML course)

Complete this exercise (from Lesson 4 of the Intro to ML course)

### 💡 What You’ll Learn
In Lesson 3 (Your First Machine Learning Model), you’ll create a machine learning model using the scikit-learn library, one of the most popular and efficient tools for data analysis.

Along the way, you’ll learn some basic techniques for working with very large datasets. These skills are especially important for modern data scientists, who often work with “big data” containing millions of variables ― many more than a human can conceivably understand! Thankfully, machines excel at discovering useful patterns in datasets that are too large for humans to wrap their heads around. :)

Once you have built a model, how good is it? How exactly should you judge how close the model’s predictions are to what actually happened? In Lesson 4 (Model Validation), you’ll use model validation to measure the quality of your model.

Happy learning,
Alexis
