### üí° What You‚Äôll Learn
In Lesson 4 (Pipelines), you‚Äôll learn a simple way to keep your data preprocessing and modeling code organized.

You‚Äôre already a bit familiar with model validation from the Intro to Machine Learning course. In Lesson 5 (Cross-Validation), you‚Äôll explore a more advanced validation technique that gives a better measure of model performance.

Happy learning,
Alexis

# [30 Days of ML] Day 14

You‚Äôve made it to the end of the Intermediate ML course! Today, you‚Äôll finish the final two lessons.

### üí° What You‚Äôll Learn
In Lesson 6 (XGBoost), you will learn how to build and optimize models with gradient boosting. This method dominates many Kaggle competitions and achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of datasets.

In Lesson 7 (Data Leakage), you will learn what data leakage is and how to prevent it. If you don't know how to prevent it, leakage will come up frequently, and it will ruin your models in subtle and dangerous ways. So, this is one of the most important concepts for practicing data scientists.

You‚Äôve come a long way, and you should be proud of all of your hard work and progress. Over the next couple of weeks, you‚Äôll apply what you‚Äôve learned in an exclusive competition, open only to others enrolled in the 30 Days of ML program. More on that, including how to get started with the competition, tomorrow!

Happy learning,
Alexis

# [30 Days of ML] Day 15

## Welcome to Week 3 of the program!

For the next two weeks, you‚Äôll be working on a beginner-friendly competition open only to people who have signed up for 30 Days of ML. The top ten teams will receive swag as prizes.

### üìã Today‚Äôs Assignment
Get started with the competition.

This is your personal invitation link to join the competition. Please do not share it with anyone else, and do not post it in the Discord community.

### üí° What You‚Äôll Learn
In the link above, you‚Äôll find a detailed introduction to Kaggle competitions (that covers how to work in a team and much more), along with a getting started tutorial that walks you through how to make your very first submission.

For the next two weeks, keep working on the competition! You won‚Äôt receive daily assignments or emails. Try to make at least one submission each day.

If you haven't finished the coursework yet, it's not too late to catch up. For help, be sure to check out 4x Kaggle Grandmaster Abhishek Thakur's video tutorials covering our past assignments (playlist found here).

Happy learning,
Alexis

# [30 Days of ML] Final Week

## Final Week's Assignments

Continue submitting to the competition.

Watch the extracurricular workshops from Google‚Äôs Developer Expert Machine Learning Program.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Important Notes
Competition

It‚Äôs not too late to get started, if you have not already. This guide has all of the orientation you need.

You can make really strong progress by doing just a little bit each day: aim to submit to the competition at least once each day. Remember you can chat with other participants in the Discussion tab, and you can view code examples from the Kaggle community in the Code tab.

Google Developer Expert Workshops

The workshops are optional for the 30 Days of ML program. There are 3 available: Intro to Supervised Classification, How to Build a Data Science Portfolio and Scikit-optimize for LightGBM.

If you have any questions, there is a Question and Answer channel for each workshop in the 30 Days of ML Discord server. Note: the speakers may not be able to get to every question. If you are able to answer a question, feel free to jump in to help others.

# [30 Days of ML] Congratulations!

We‚Äôve reached the end of the 30 Days of ML program!

You should be proud of all that you have accomplished in just a month ‚Äì you have leveled up your Kaggle profile, completed courses, and submitted to Kaggle competitions.

You can find the final competition rankings on the private leaderboard here. The top ten teams will receive swag as prizes! If you have won a prize, we‚Äôll reach out to you soon.

If you haven‚Äôt completed the entire program, don‚Äôt be discouraged. All of the learning courses are always publicly available to complete at your own pace & you‚Äôll receive a certificate for each course you complete. You can find all of the assignments here.

What‚Äôs next?

I strongly encourage you to join another competition next month. If you‚Äôre not sure which competition would be a good fit, we recommend the September Tabular Playground competition. For help on how to get started, check out this Getting Started Notebook.

The best way to keep learning is by jumping in, and you now have a strong foundation.
